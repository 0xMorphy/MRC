# Building Decentralized AI

December 9th 2023 the Decentralized AI communitty assembled from around the world in Ausitn, TX in order to begin contributing to this repository.

The objectives are to define both the tech stack and the practical technical standards for collabortion between everyone in the community.

Morpheus both encourages and will incentive developers who propose or impliment new standards or integrations between open source projects in DeAI.

## 4. Bittensor	

### Carro	& Const

Bittensor's vision for a decentralized AI company has captivated a large number of people in the arenas of Artificial Intelligence and computer science, who have yearned for an alternative to the top-down world being created by our current technology giants. However the promise of what Bittensor is and can be has been masked by large technical barriers to understanding, and thus has not been well digested by non-technical audiences.

## 5. FreedomGPT	

### John Arrow

FreedomGPT 2.0 is your launchpad for AI. With our “App Store” for AI no technical knowledge is required to use the latest AI models in both a private and secure manner. For example, the Liberty model included in FreedomGPT will answer any question without censorship, judgment, or post output bias.
