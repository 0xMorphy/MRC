# Morpheus Request for Comments (MRC)
Proposals to improve any of the Morpheus Reference Implementations (MRIs). 

See the details on all the of the MRIs here: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/Docs/blob/main/!KEYDOCS%20README%20FIRST!/Reference%20Implementations.md

Similar to the function of the [ERC system](https://eips.ethereum.org/erc ) serves in Ethereum, the MRC process provides a common language to describe interactions between models, agents, compute, payments, funding and so forth.

There is a dedicated forum on Discord for the discussion of MRCs here: https://discord.com/channels/1151741790408429580/1218593251079094383
