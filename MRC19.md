# MRC 19: Cosmos & Thorchain Expansion of Morpheus

## Status: Pending - Technical dependencies on Thorchain upgrade

## History
The original Morpheus whitepaper proposed using Thorchain yield as the means for Capital Providers to contribute to Morpheus.

## Tech Problem
While the Smart Contracts were in development the open source devs notes that there was a feature missing from Thorchain that would make this possible.

## Dependency
This missing feature is support for multi-outputs from yield generated from a Thorchain Saver. Currently when a Thorchain Saver vault is set up the yield can only be returned to the same address as the that contributed the crypto to the Saver Vault.

## Solution
When Thorchain adds support for Multiple addresses to be rewarded yield, then the Morpheus Capital Provider can be extended to Thorchain yield types.

## Value
This would be a substaintial upgrade as Thorchain create sustainable native yield in BTC, ETH, AVAX, USDT, BCH, USDC, BNB, LTC, DOGE & ATOM. 
This represents yield from many of the most active chains and would add a great deal of the most active crypto communities to the ranks of Morpheus Capital Providers.
