## MRC21: Non Fungible Agents

### Abstract
As a way of identifying agents on the blockchain, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. The MOR21 Non-Fungible Agent (NFA) is a technical framework, defining a set of rules and interfaces for creating and managing unique smart agents in the Morpheus ecosystem.

Tied by hash to the Smart Agent code, this MOR21 smart contract adds key features to the agent toolkit.

### Metadata 
A Non-Fungible Agent requires identifiers including name and symbol identifiers.  A URI (uniform resource identifier) allows for the navigation of instruction to a Smart Agent.  A toolset and functional limits are included in this data and segmented in a marketplace.

### Functionality
A Non-fungible agent has an Agentic ABI, providing a functional interface to the agent, with a minimum weights and model requirement.  

### Testing benchmarks
A Non-Fungible Agent must include performance claims at the time of publication to chain.  Users of an agent can calibrate for accuracy and fidelity to test a Smart Agent’s use of inference

### Trackable Ownership
Expanding on ownership of NFTs each Smart Agent is assigned an Agent Identification Number and linked to is owner through the use of the ownerOf function 

### Mitigating Stake
To mitigate against malicious usage, the agent creator stakes a proportional amount to the cost of the Smart Agent’s license and usage costs.

### Ownership, Lease, and License Usage  
Agents can be bought and sold in a marketplace, similar to a non-fungible token.  A multisig-type ownership function allows for fee and license distribution amongst multiple parties. Fees are collected based on the amount of inference used, the computer used, and the, complexity of tasks performed.  Agents can be made available to accomplish remote tasks in exchange for MOR.  Availability can be exclusive or open, providing immutable access rights.

### Security
The same tooling that secures the non-fungible token also secures the non-fungible agent.
