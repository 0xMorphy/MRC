## Morpheus Request for Comment Standard 00

Each Morpheus Request for Comment should include the following:	

- Problem
- Solution
		Abstract
		Development strategy
		Tech Stack

- End Results

- Value To Users

- New weights requested
	
- Effort required to Implement
  Deliverables
	Meta
		Time to expire
		Dev Id assigned
		Tie to deliverables/testing

- Google Drive or Notion is fine for an initial draft, however for the MRC to be included for discussion all the details of the MRC should be published on Github .
	Add the MRC details in a new file in the MRC repo with a matching file named MRC####.md so everyone can comment on it directly in Github.
