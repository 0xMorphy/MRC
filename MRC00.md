# MRC 00: Morpheus Request for Comment Standards & Guide

### What is an MRC?
MRC stands for Morpheus Request for Comments.  It’s a document that describes a change to Morpheus. 

### Who’s it for?
Contributors to the MOR codebase, who are looking for direction or inspiration on how to get weights. 
Users in the MOR Ecosystem who want to suggest specific changes to Morpheus

### Why an MRC Guide?
Well formatted MRCs are easy to review and discuss amongst the community. 
It allows weights to be distributed only to people who have provided good reason to receive them. 

### Where and when can I submit my MRC?
Until the end of Fair Launch, the MRCs will first be on GitHub and then on MOR.Software, ultimately reflected on other dashboards. 

### How do I write a well-formed MRC?

- Add your MRC number and link to the full file here: https://github.com/MorpheusAIs/MRC/blob/main/README.md
- Google Drive or Notion are good tools for drafting however for the MRC to be considered, all the details of the MRC should be published on Github.

## MRC FAQ

Can an MRC be submitted by a group?
↳ Yes, but weights can be attributed to only one DeveloperID.   

Can I submit and manage my MRCs through my Profile page on MOR.software?
↳ Yes, that’s probably the easiest way to do it.

Can I include diagrams, images, and videos in an MRC?
↳ Please do.  And keep any files under 25 MB.  100MB total per MRC

Can I just submit code as the MRC?
↳ No.  The point of the MRC is to think first, code second.  

What if I’m not a developer?
↳ No problem.  Anyone can create an MRC.
