## Morpheus Request for Comment Standard 00

Each Morpheus Request for Comment should include the following:	

- Link to details of the MRC.
	
	- Add the MRC details in a new file in the MRC repo with a matching file named MRC####.md so everyone can comment on it directly in Github.
	- Include the link to the full MRC file in the summary in the Readme. 
	- Google Drive or Notion is fine for an initial draft before posting to the MRC repo, however for the MRC to be considered all the details of the MRC should be published on Github.
