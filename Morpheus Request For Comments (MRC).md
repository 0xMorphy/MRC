# Morpheus Request for Comments (MRC)
List of proposals extending Decentralized AI. 
Similar to the function of the ERC system serves in Ethereum.

## MRC 20: "Automated Recurring Revenue / Rewards" (ARR) - The MOR 20 Token Standard
- Status: **Under Discussion** 
- Description:  Automated Recurring Revenue / Rewards (ARR) Generalizing the TCM Model - MOR20 Token Standard
Any project inside or even outside the context of Web3 & AI, can use Morpheus to bootstrap their project with the push of a button.
The use the MOR20 Smart Contracts to collect stETH in order to provide Automated Recurring Revenue (ARR) to the project is a compelling new framework.
Easily create a fair launch for projects, fair price discovery mechanism and access the large network effect of the Morpheus community.
This model can be extended to many software as a service projects as a means of building reacurring revenue / payments from users via yield.
The Morpheus platform charges only 0.35% (35 basis points) of the stETH yield collected by projects using the MOR20 Smart Contracts / Dashboards.
This yield collected is added to the Morpheus Protocol Liquidity and provides on going support for further Dashboards, Smart Contract development and audits.
This adds to the Network Effect of Morpheus when it comes to bootstraping new projects, growing liquidity for all MOR20 Smart Contract users.
