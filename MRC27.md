## Morpheus MRC 27: Progressive Web App specification

### 1. Problem definition

Currently there is no well defined architecture of how a PWA will function - PWA will also enable folks to access morpheus application with just a link.


### 2. Solution definition
#### 2.1 Abstract

General overview of architecture needs to be created, based on current idea of how Morpheus PWA is gonna work. This overview needs to include all the details.

#### 2.2 Delivery strategy

My plan is to write an initial draft and attach it to this MRC and put it up for discussion. Any interested users that want to contribute will also be added to Discord discussion and if needed we can even organise separate meetings to discuss the ideas and details.

#### 2.3 Tech stack

As this is purely documentation based MRC not a lot of technologies will be used. For discussion we will use Google docs and Github issues, together with Discord.

### 3. End result

End result will be an succesful deployment of PWA.

### 4. Value proposition

Will be updated


### 5. Reference implementations

Will be updated

### 6. Dependencies

Will be updated

### 7. Weights requested

I belive this adds a lot of value to Morpheus projects for various reasons - putting an estimate of 50 weights 

### 8. Time to complete

Will be updated

### 9. Deliverables

1. Deployed PWA
2. Succesful testing by community

### 10. Why me

I have a team of battel hardened developers who have been working in web3 ecosystem for 4+ years now and have built countless web3 applications which are fully functional with a web3 wallet. The team consist of folks who are known for shipping robust products. Will be putting a team doc here as well going forward.
